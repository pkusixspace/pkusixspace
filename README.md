# Introduction
The Multimodal Data Fusing and Processing Laboratory at Peking University is an essential part of the National Software Engineering Research Center. In this collaborative environment, faculty, students, and software engineers jointly develop advanced algorithms for multimodal data analysis and big data storage solutions. Our research primarily focuses on large-scale multimodal language models, including pre-training and fine-tuning, LLM evaluation, and various real-world applications. Driven by practical objectives, we have successfully deployed our work in large-scale, real-world projects in fields such as medical artificial intelligence and power grid technology.

The laboratory has designed a verifiable, high-reliability data management model tailored to precision medicine data and knowledge. Leveraging this technology, we created a robust, reusable, high-quality clinical big data platform ([data.ncrc.org.cn](data.ncrc.org.cn)). This platform integrates comprehensive clinical data collection and management, follow-up services, and continuously adopts cutting-edge information technologies to enhance the efficiency, quality, and accessibility of medical services. Consequently, it facilitates ongoing progress and advanced developments in healthcare. Currently supporting over 1,000 medical institutions and managing more than 1,000 online queues for over 1 million people, the platform has generated significant social and economic benefits. To date, it has resulted in over 50 research publications, including more than 20 focused on clinical phenotypes, imaging, and genetic data analysis. In addition, it has secured over 20 patents, registered more than 20 software copyrights, and received a second-place award from the Ministry of Education and the Peking University Industry-University-Research Collaboration Award.
